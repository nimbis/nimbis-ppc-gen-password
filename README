nimbis-ppc-gen-password

Generates a password for use with pypicloud, but with fewer rounds in
the hash than the passwords generated by the pypicloud-gen-password
script.

Setup:

	make reqs

Running:

	./nimbis-ppc-gen-password

	Then put the resulting, hashed password, (along with your
	desired username), into pypicloud.conf and put the same
	username and password (in plaintext this time) into your
	~/.pip/pip.conf file as follows:

	[global]
	extra-index-url = https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@your-pypicloud.net/pypi/
